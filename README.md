Forest-Growth-Days
==================

IDL code for calculating forest growth days

This program calculates the number of growth days according to
Linacre (1977) and Ellery et al. (1991). The results are used 
to determine fuelwood scarcity as described in the TEAM Fuelwood
Scarcity Implementation Manual available at: 
www.teamnetwork.org/files/anp/pdfs/TEAM%20Monitoring%20Protocol_Fuelwood%20Scarcity_February%202011.pdf
The input data are:
1) Daily temperature (one band per day since beginning of year)
2) Daily precipitation (one band per day since beginning of year)
3) Mean daily range of temperature (one band)
4) Altitude (one band)
5) Latitude (one band)
1 km resolution matching the respective 10 x 10 km landscape boundary.
